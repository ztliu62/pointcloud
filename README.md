# Point Cloud Examples

This project presents a demonstration of using [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) and [OctoMap](https://octomap.github.io/).

In PCL, the point clouds are generated from multiple depth images. Post-processing includes *downsampling*, *statistical outlier
removal*, *Moving least Square Resampling* and *Meshing by triangulation*, etc.
